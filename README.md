# CEG-3155 Digital systems II
Course taken in Fall 2019 at University Of Ottawa  
Professor: Sawsan Abdul-Majid, Ph.D., PEng, SMIEEE  

>**Description of the course**
Concepts of Sequential Logic: Finite State Machine model, state transition tables and
state diagrams, Mealy and Moore models. Sequential circuits design: state reduction
and assignment; implementation with D or JK flip-flops. Incompletely specified
sequential circuits. Alternative State Machine representations: Algorithmic State
Machines (ASM) and Hardware Description Languages (e.g., VHDL.). Synchronous
sequential logic design with programmable logic (PLD, ROM, FPGA). Applications in
designing computer interfaces and controllers. Asynchronous circuits. Hazards.
